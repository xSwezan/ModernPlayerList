Fake It 'Till You Make It, or fitumi, is a Lua faking library intended for helping to create comprehensive unit tests for Lua code bases. While not required, fitumi was designed with Roblox development as the primary use-case. Fitumi's design is inspired in part by [FakeItEasy](https://fakeiteasy.github.io/).

Fitumi comes paired with TypeScript annotation files for easy installation into a roblox-ts project and is published to NPM under the [@rbxts/fitumi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rbxts/fitumi) package.

## Installation
### roblox-ts
Simply install to your [roblox-ts](https://roblox-ts.com/) project as follows:
```
npm i @rbxts/fitumi
```

### Wally
[Wally](https://github.com/UpliftGames/wally/) users can install this package by adding the following line to their `Wally.toml` under `[dependencies]`:
```
fitumi = "bytebit/fitumi@1.0.10"
```

Then just run `wally install`.

### From model file
Model files are uploaded to every release as `.rbxmx` files. You can download the file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Bytebit-Org/fitumi/releases) and load it into your project however you see fit.

### From model asset
New versions of the asset are uploaded with every release. The asset can be added to your Roblox Inventory and then inserted into your Place via Toolbox by getting it [here.](https://www.roblox.com/library/7881397561/fitumi-Package)

## Example
```lua
local fitumi = require(path.to.fitumi)
local a = fitumi.a

local fakeDependency = a.fake()
a.callTo(fakeDependency["foo"], fakeDependency, fitumi.wildcard):returns("bar")

local targetObject = TargetClass.new(fakeDependency)
targetObject:doSomething()

assert(a.callTo(fakeDependency["foo"], fakeDependency, fitumi.wildcard):didHappen(), "No call to foo happened")
assert(targetObject.fooResult == "bar", "targetObject's foo result does not match provided foo result")
assert(a.writeTo(fakeDependency, "expectedKey", "expectedValue"):didHappen(), "targetObject did not write \"expectedValue\" to \"expectedKey\"")
```
